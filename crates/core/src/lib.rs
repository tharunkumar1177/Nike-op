//! Edge Optimizer Core Library
//!
//! Shared functionality for all Edge Optimizer processes
//!
//! Architecture:
//! - Runner process owns the system tray (uses tray_icon module)
//! - Settings process owns all UI windows (uses gui, flyout modules)
//! - IPC communication via named pipes (ipc module)
